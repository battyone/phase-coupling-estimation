%fit_model  Multivariate Phase Distribution Estimation 
% 
%           Description: 
%           K = FIT_MODEL(P,VARS) estimates the parameters of a multivariate 
%               phase distribution using the distribution and method described in [1].
%
%           Inputs:
%           P = d-by-n matrix of phase measurements where d is the dimensionality, 
%               and n is the number of data points.
%
%           optional:
%           eps = small variable (e.g. 0.01) used to compute the
%                 regularized matrix inverse
%                 G^{-1}_{reg} =  (G^T G + eps Id)^{-1}G^T
%                 [section 6.4.1 in http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/]
%
%           Outputs:
%           K = the estimated K for the multivariate phase distribution
